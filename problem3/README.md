# Code Review: Wallet Page Component

This document outlines the inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the original implementation of the WalletPage component, along with their solutions.

## Original Code Issues

### 1. Filter Logic Errors
- Used undefined variable `lhsPriority` in filter function
- Logic was inverted - returned `true` for zero/negative balances only
- Always returned `false` for positive balances
- Calculated `balancePriority` but never used it

**Solution**: Simplified filter logic to properly handle positive balances.

### 2. Sort Function Incompleteness
- Missing return statement for equal priorities
- Could lead to undefined sorting behavior
- No secondary sort criteria

**Solution**: Added complete sort logic with secondary sorting by amount when priorities are equal.

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- `blockchain` parameter in `getPriority` was typed as `any`
- Lacked proper type definitions for blockchain names

**Solution**: 
- Added `Blockchain` type using union types
- Properly typed all parameters and functions

### 4. Unnecessary Double Processing
- `sortedBalances` was processed twice
- Created `formattedBalances` array but never used it
- Performed multiple array iterations unnecessarily

**Solution**: Combined operations into a single pass using chained array methods.

### 5. Memory Inefficiency
- Created unnecessary intermediate arrays
- Redundant data transformations

**Solution**: 
- Removed unnecessary intermediate array (`formattedBalances`)
- Combined transformations into a single operation

### 6. React-Specific Issues
- Used array index as React key (anti-pattern)
- Could cause issues with list updates and re-rendering

**Solution**: 
- Added proper unique ID to balance interface
- Used unique ID as React key

### 7. Dependency Array Issues
- `useMemo` depended on `prices` but wasn't using it in calculation
- Potential for stale data or unnecessary recalculations

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `useMemo` dependencies
- Moved USD value calculation into memoized function

### 8. Props Issues
- Extended `BoxProps` but only destructured `children`
- Destructured `children` but never used it

**Solution**: 
- Removed unused props
- Simplified props interface

## Benefits of Refactored Code

1. **Better Performance**
   - Single-pass data transformation
   - Proper memoization
   - Reduced memory usage

2. **Improved Type Safety**
   - Strong TypeScript types
   - No `any` types
   - Better IDE support and catch errors at compile time

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Clearer code structure
   - Removed redundant operations
   - Better organized types and interfaces

4. **React Best Practices**
   - Proper key usage
   - Efficient rendering
   - Clean props handling
